# Now

Updated 2026-09-17. **Shipped: req-01–09, req-11–23, req-25–31, req-33–98** (req-10 pending; req-24
gated; req-32 dropped; req-77 PAUSED). **Gym-flow batch 3 (Emilio's in-app feedback JSON, 2026-09-16) all
LIVE:** req-92 rest pill bigger · req-93 main bold/unlabelled + WU/finisher tag · req-94 Today one list,
no header (DEC-049) · req-95 feedback textarea iOS-zoom · **req-96** "Next time"→"↑ you beat last time"
(per-exercise any axis, name the win; `beat-last-time.js` — DEC-050). **req-96 aftermath (Emilio
"fix now" 2026-09-17):** **req-97 LIVE** (deleted dead `formatProgressionLine`; rest of progression is
LIVE, corrected). **req-98 READY→Builder** — the editable timed-actual capture ALREADY exists (req-85,
`SetLogForm` DurationTimer); Emilio flags exercises manually (no migration); the only real fix is a guard
so a newly-flagged exercise doesn't claim a false "↑ Longer" vs an old unstructured record. Note n1
(Finish/Abandon) folds into PAUSED **req-77**. Owed by Emilio: on-device feel of batch 3 + req-96 (pill
overlap, real-iPhone no-zoom, beat-line wording); flag his timed exercises; live `./plan preview`.

## Milestone (Emilio, 2026-09-07)

> In-gym flow **flawless** first, then **program-creation**. Nothing heavy before the flow is flawless.

Phase 1 in-gym flow (now, browser-only) · Phase 2 program-creation · Phase 3 backend/users/exercise-DB/AI/styling (gated on the backend fork).

## Next — READY, held for Emilio's go (built via DEC-037 ephemeral-agent batches)

**IN FLIGHT (2026-09-17):** `req-97` handed to Builder (delete dead `formatProgressionLine`).
`req-98` **NEEDS DECISION** — capture the ACTUAL timed duration (A editable / B countdown / C
stopwatch); builds on req-85's `hasDuration`/`durationSec`. Batch 3 + req-96 all LIVE (top).

**READY, held:**
- `req-10` **first-time-exercise setup flow** — auto-prompt on a no-history exercise; never invents
  the first weight (DEC-012). Larger; needs flow design first. **[ux-feel]**

**Gym-flow batch 2 (Emilio 2026-09-14) — req-76..86** (raw: BACKLOG N1–N11). In flight this session
(order at top); req-78 decided 2026-09-16 (remove rest view, self-paced, build last). PAUSED: req-77
affordance. NEEDS DECISION: req-82 empty-day Start, req-83 mid-workout value→default (brushes core
rule), req-84 auto-complete, req-85 timed (model shape), req-86 dev note-capture.

## Needs decisions — parked until their phase

- **`req-24` native confirm/alert → inline UI** — 10 sites; needs the inline-confirm *pattern*
  first (bar/sheet vs two-tap vs undo). **[ux-feel]** Spec: `work/req-24-inline-confirm-alert.md`.
- **Backend fork** (gates Phase 3): browser-only vs database/server (+users, AI key). Decide first.
- **History recalc from a non-latest workout** (Phase 1) — see BACKLOG. **Program model** (Phase 2).

## Where to read

`PLANNING.md` (planning role + the two-agent build loop) → `work/BACKLOG.md` → `rules/DESIGN.md`
before UI/UX → `rules/WORKFLOW.md` for process → `rules/CLOSEOUT.md` to close a req. `README.md`
is the product contract.
